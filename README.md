# Blockchain Application: Get Balance and Show Message
This is a very simple application showcasing how blockchain works in the most barebones way. It is a single page application that lets a user connect to their wallet, get their balance, and will display a message on the screen that only 2 wallet addresses can retrieve. This application is hosted on Fleek using IPFS, which is a decentralized file system that works well with blockchain applications.
